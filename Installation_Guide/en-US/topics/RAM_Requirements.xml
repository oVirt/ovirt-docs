	<title>Virtualization Host RAM Requirements</title>
	<para>
		It is recommended that virtualization hosts have at least 2&nbsp;<acronym>GB</acronym> of <acronym>RAM</acronym>. The amount of RAM required varies depending on:
	</para>
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				guest operating system requirements,
			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				guest application requirements, and
			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				memory activity and usage of guests.
			</para>
		</listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	<para>
		The fact that <acronym>KVM</acronym> is able to over-commit physical <acronym>RAM</acronym> for virtualized guests must also be taken into account. This allows provisioning of guests with <acronym>RAM</acronym> requirements greater than physically present on the basis where not all guests will be at peak load concurrently. <acronym>KVM</acronym> does this by only allocating <acronym>RAM</acronym> for guests as required and shifting underutilized guests into swap.
	</para>
	<para>
		A maximum of 1&nbsp;TB of RAM per virtualization host is currently supported.
